# Robust-Image-Geolocalization
Training the existing TransGeo Model on a combination of Noisy and Clean Images ==> 
Generates better accuracies when running evaluations.

The main code is in the TransGeo2022 folder. The results of the training were too big to be included in the GitHub repo so user will have to train themselves unfortunately.

This repository provides the code modifications from the model referenced in the paper: ["TransGeo: Transformer Is All You Need for Cross-view Image Geo-localization"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.00097.pdf) by Dr. Sijie Zhu, Dr. Chen Chen, and Dr. Mubarak Shah of UCF CRCV.

I ran the models through CRCV GPU Cluster accessible thru UCF VPN.
