# Robust-Image-Geolocalization
The main code is in the TransGeo2022 folder. The results of the training were too big to be included in the GitHub repo so users will have to train and evaluate themselves unfortunately.

This repository provides my code modifications to train TransGeo on a combination of Noisy and Clean Images. Original code is from the model referenced in the paper: ["TransGeo: Transformer Is All You Need for Cross-view Image Geo-localization"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.00097.pdf) by Dr. Sijie Zhu, Dr. Chen Chen, and Dr. Mubarak Shah of UCF CRCV.

My conclusion from experiments: Training the existing TransGeo Model on a combination of Noisy and Clean Images generates significantly improved accuracies when running evaluations. Results are described in the report linked [here](https://www.crcv.ucf.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Akhil-Final-report.pdf) written by myself with input from my mentors (below).

I ran the models through CRCV GPU Cluster accessible thru UCF VPN.

Special thanks to my mentors Parth Kulkarni and Dr. Gaurav Nayak for their help in this project.
