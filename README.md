# Robust-Image-Geolocalization
Modifying existing TransGeo2022 model. Training the existing TransGeo Model on a combination of Noisy and Clean Images ==> 
Should generate better accuracies when running evaluations.

This repository provides the code modifications from the model referenced in the paper: ["TransGeo: Transformer Is All You Need for Cross-view Image Geo-localization"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.00097.pdf) by Dr. Sijie Zhu, Dr. Chen Chen, and Dr. Mubarak Shah of UCF CRCV.
